# ‚òòÔ∏è Effect Sandbox

Storing Effect learnings and projects. Effect is an open-source library that allows you to build software in a purely functional manner with the next principles

- _Dynamic System_:A fully-fledged functional Effect system for typescript with a rich standard library.
- _High Productivity_: A typescript library inspired by scala's ZIO and Haskell's RIO architecture.
- _Developed By Us_: We have proudly shaped a library that continues to grow along with community contributions.

Effect is a zero dependency set of libraries to write highly productive purely functional TypeScript at scale.

Effect is a set of libraries designed with testability in mind from the start and presents an opinionated approach
that make testing simple out of the box

Effect includes full port of ZIO, a functional programming library fo Scala that feature a highly scalable fiber-based
effect data type as its backbone and contains a huge set of useful data-types that are thought to be used in everyday
application development.
